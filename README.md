# 🧠 NLP + Vector Database Training Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques combined with a **Vector Database** to process textual data and perform intelligent search operations.

The main objective of this project is to clean text data, apply linguistic preprocessing, generate embeddings, and store them inside a vector database for fast similarity search.

This project was completed as part of a training program to gain practical exposure to real-world NLP workflows.
